% Acknowledge any substantial help, with either the project work or the report, from people and other informal sources.

% A significant portion of the development process research and discoveries was made through continuous integration and debugging, inspecting source code and documentation, and through the use of the internet and debugging tools.

Technical material used within the literature review and project planning was sourced from the course material provided and learnt in the BEng Hons, Software Engineering course at the University of Greenwich. This includes methodologies and techniques used during the research and development of this project.
During the practical implementation of the project, the use of the internet was essential to the development of the project. This includes the use of StackOverflow, GitHub Gists, Microsoft documentation, and other sources of information that were used to help solve problems and provide information on how to use specific features of the C\# language and Roslyn API. Debugging tools were also of a significant use in areas of development where online resources and documentation were either not available, not helpful or very sparse and limited in information with many of the discoveries made during development obtained through debugging and inspecting runtime objects.
Peer reviews were used during the creation of this report to help improve the quality of the report and to ensure that the report was of a high standard.
