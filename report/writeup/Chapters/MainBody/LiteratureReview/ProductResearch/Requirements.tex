% Requirements
% Analysis of requirements
% Discuss the requirements of the project, and what is needed to complete the project.
% Comparison of systems
% For some projects there may be similar existing systems. This would be a good place to identify these, compare them and elicit requirements from them.
% Requirements elicitation
% Perhaps you have conducted some actual research with questionnaires and interviews and such like (having obtained research ethics clearance of course). This would be a good place to discuss this.
% Functional requirements
% A clear statement of functional requirements is the starting point for your design. Without this you will look foolish.
% Non-functional requirements
% Clear statement of non-functional requirements. It may be an idea here to refer back to your earlier LSEPi section as compliance is likely to (and should) be an important aspect here.
