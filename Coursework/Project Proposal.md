## Project Proposal

This can change but try to include important key words and give an indication of your approach or key questions.

### Introduction

By reference to the Journals, give an overview the subject area, the key points in the subject area and what others have done in the topic area over the last four years. Use this referenced material to justify why the subject area is valid as topic area for a final year project.

Unlike compilers which optimise code at build time this project aims to optimise the source code of a program. By optimise we mean to make the source code easier to maintain and understand. For example this would consist of making use of various software paradigms, practices and methodologies.

### Problem Domain

By reference to the Journals identify the key problems that most people have worked on or shown interest in.
Identify a problem / question / approach, highlighting its originality and/or significance, explain how it contributes / develops the topic area.  
Identify recommendations for further work that will form the basis of your project.

Many projects become hard to maintain or work on as they grow in size or are transferred from team to team (INSERT FAILED PROJECT METRICS). This is especially true for projects that are not well documented or have a large code base. This project aims to solve this problem by creating a tool that can be used to optimise the source code and analyse the functions to generate documentation and metrics. This will allow developers to easily understand the code base and make changes to it without having to spend time understanding the code base. This will also allow developers to easily identify areas of the code that can be optimised and improved.

### Methodology

By reference to the Journals, identify the variety approaches and methodologies that have been used / developed in the identified problem domain and state, what you will use as a methodology, test-bed, programming framework, simulator, real device, standards, mathematical model.

### Evaluation

By reference to the Journals, identify how you will evaluate / measure the success of your project. What is your evaluation path? What will be the metrics of your productâ€™s success?
