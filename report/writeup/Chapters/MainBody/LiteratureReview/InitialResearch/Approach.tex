This project seeks to provide a solution to the problem of creating high quality code and structured code. Research was made into the area of software quality and the different approaches that have been proposed to measure this using papers and resources found primarily on on IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library. The research conducted on these sites have been specifically conducted on the area of software source code quality and the development processes around it. Additional areas of research that were relevant looked into the fields of code schemas, code analysis and developer preferences. 
There is a lack of standardization in the way software quality is measured while there exists a demand for high quality code. While there have been many proposed approaches to measuring software quality, not many of them have not been widely adopted and there is a lack of agreement on how to do this \citep{6606742}.
% This project aims to create a solution to these problems by making a tool that can analyze source code and format it to a user-defined schema while making use of object oriented programming principles.
