\subsection{Justification}
% Justification of the suitability of a Methodology or a Framework followed.
% Justify the choice of methodology or framework followed in the project.
The choice to work on the discussed domain was made due to the lack of uniformity in coding styles and how this can lead to a decrease in efficiency within development teams, thereby causing increased costs and time to develop a project. The use of the spiral model methodology is beneficial in this project as source code analysis tools have to be made up of various components that run independently from each other due to the complexity of programming languages and their respective syntaxes. Through the use of a spiral model methodology, the project can be broken down into smaller components that can be developed and tested independently by integrating a continuous integration (CI) model to the development pipeline.
