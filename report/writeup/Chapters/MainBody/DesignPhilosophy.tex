\subsection{Design philosophy}

\subsubsection{Object oriented programming principles and design patterns}

There are many object oriented programming principles and design patterns that can be used to create a well structured codebase. In the paper \cite{10.1145/3428029.3428047} a few principles and patterns are discussed in relation to code quality. The principles and patterns discussed are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Documentation - Comments;
	\item Presentation - Layout \& formatting;
	\item Algorithmic - Flow, idiom \& expressions;
	\item Structure - Decomposition \& modularization;
\end{itemize}

My proposal will want to make use of as many of these principles and patterns as possible in order to improve the quality of the code that can be produced. Abstraction and inherence can be extremely useful when it comes to the structure of a program and the deduplication of code as well as maintainability, which was also mentioned by \cite{8681007} where they said "Modularization of code marks better reuse of the code and compilation time".

However it is important that one doesn't abuse these abilities as they can lead to code smells which affect program program comprehensibility \citep{8681007, ImpactOfAntipatterns}, maintainability \citep{8681007, ImpactOfAntipatterns2, CodeSmellsAndMaintainability} and testability \citep{8681007, TestCasesAndCodeQuality}. As indicated in the paper by \cite{10.1145/3555228.3555268} there are several types of code smells, such as: Comments; Duplicated code; Feature envy; Large class/God class; Long method; Lazy class; Long parameter list and Shotgun surgery. Therefore in considering a solution, care will be needed about the use of these principles and patterns such as abstraction and inheritance and automated comments as they can lead to these undesirable code smells.
