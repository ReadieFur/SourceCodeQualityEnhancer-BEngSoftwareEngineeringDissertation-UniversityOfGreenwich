\subsection{Product evaluation}

Throughout the development of the project, the goals that were set out to be solved had, for the most part, been completed. The basis of a tool to restructure source code had successfully been created. From what was made it shows that being able to easily restructure a programs source would drastically reduce the time required to format documents to a users preferences compared to if it were to be done manually.
The performance of the tool runs fast enough within an integrated environment that it would not hinder the containing process or the development for the end user.
With various ways to run the program too the user can choose how they would like to run the program and are therefore less prone to vendor lock in.
