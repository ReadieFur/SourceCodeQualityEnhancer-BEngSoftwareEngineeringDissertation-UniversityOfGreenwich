% Reflection
% Wrap the whole thing up with some conclusions. A reflective approach is increasingly popular but many students struggle with introducing a critical personal perspective.
\subsubsection{Reflection}
From what was discovered in the literature review, it is clear that there are many ways to improve the quality of a codebase. The use of object oriented programming principles and design patterns can be used to create a well structured codebase. It is important to note that these principles and patterns can be abused and lead to code smells which affect program comprehensibility, maintainability and testability, however the ultimate result of the code reproduced by this program will be down to the configuration that is provided by the end user.
From the prototypes that were created, the goals of this project have been updated to facilitate the integration of a new, custom, regex based naming engine that can be used to convert an input string to a desired output string based on the regex pattern.
Further research will have to be conducted into the technical details of how to achieve this. Good areas to look into include: Practical applications of static code analysis; Software engineering standards; Object oriented programming principles; Design patterns; Cyclic references and ideal flow control; etc.
