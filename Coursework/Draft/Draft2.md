### Problem Domain

Quotes to include:
- All selected studies did not analyze how co-occurrences were refactored (ACM-10.1145_3555228.3555268)
- ForRationale, most teachers mentioned the need for studentsto ensure their code can be read by others, either for facilitatingteamwork (First of all, that it’s easy to read.) or to support futuremaintenance (someone else might come along and have to fix yourprogram or change your program). This finding is consistent withthose reported by Börstler et al. [5]. (ACM-10.1145_3428029.3428047)
- researches dedicated in improvement of software quality that adhere to this paradigm are demanded. (IEEE-6606742)
- IT Programs often fail to deliver intended results due to poor program management and governance. (IEEE-7372958)
- We found that our detected issues are of concern to real-world developers and addressing these issues can improve the performance and robustness of the original projects. (IEEE-8802820)
- it is necessary to find bugs in early stages (IEEE-8681007)
- It is very important that software adapts to change in environment or other modification easily. (IEEE-8681007)
- Modularization of code marks better reuse of the code and compilation time. (IEEE-8681007)
- helpful for coder to better understand and read source code. (IEEE-8681007)
- Developing healthy and secure software is always a challenge (IEEE-8681007)
- Bugs in simpler codes were easy to find than in complex codes (IEEE-8681007)

Indirect quotes:
- Poorly written code can have negative effects on comprehensibility and maintainability as well as increase maintenance effort and costs. (ACM-10.1145_3379597.3387457, ACM-10.1145_3428029.3428047, IEEE-6606742, IEEE-7372958)
- In the research conducted by (IEEE-6606742), they investigates a large number of papers investigation software quality, amongust them only 14.4% went on to discuss the real problems of software quality and of those papers only 2.7% proposed solutions to solve the problem.
  - Their paper was an investigation into the issue and why it is important to solve it, not a paper to propose a solution.
  - With my research and their findings in mind, it is clear that there is a problem with software quality and that there are proposed solutions to solve it, however the number of real world solutions are not adequate.

Statements:
- High quality source code becomes increasingly importatnt as a project grows.
- Poorly written code can result in projects becoming too expensive and difficult to maintain.
- Research indicates that there is a lack of standardisation in regards to software quality.
  - I believe part of the reason for this is due to the fact that software quality is a broad topic and the definition of what is considered high quality software can vary from person to person.
- A factor that dosent help this is that teachers often struggle with the task of detemining software quality.
  - This has a knock on effect for the students as they progress further into the industry as they will have a lack of understanding of what is considered high quality software and so poorly developed code will become more common.

### Methodology

Quotes to include: 
- complexity  and metrics proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer[1] (ACM-10.1145_2507288.2507312)
- current approaches do not take the developer’s perception of design issuesinto account. (ACM-10.1145_3379597.3387457)
- Code quality aspects are categorised into tenquality criteria, relating todocumentation(naming, headers, com-ments),presentation( layout, formatting),algorithmic(flow, idiom,expressions) andstructure(decomposition, modularisation) [23]. (ACM-10.1145_3428029.3428047)
- Code style refers to elements of the code that affect a developer’sability to understand a program, given the program works correctly. (ACM-10.1145_3428029.3428047)
- there are several types of code smells, such as: Comments, Duplicated Code, Feature Envy, Large Class/God Class, Long Method, Lazy Class, Long Parameter List and Shotgun Surgery. (ACM-10.1145_3555228.3555268)
- Software Quality can be defined as the degree of conformance to explicit or implicit requirements and expectations. (IEEE-8681007)
- Without proper guidance on how to manifest and optimize detected issues, developers cannot easily improve their code. (IEEE-8802820)
- Modularization of code marks better reuse of the code and compilation time. (IEEE-8681007)
- Detecting and removing duplicate code results in lesser lines of code and as a result lesser compilation time. (IEEE-8681007)

Indirect quotes:
- Small memory leaks can lead to serious waste of memory resources. (IEEE-8802820)
  - By having a well structured program, it will be easier to spot issues that may lead to memory leaks.

Statements:
- Some factors that contribute to poor quality code are:
  - Poor naming choices
  - Poor formatting
  - Poor documentation
  - Poor structure
  - Poor modularisation
- We can mitigate some of these factors with a tool that will analyze and interpret source code and then reformat the code to adhear to better coding practices.
- As previously mentioned software quality is a broad topic and the definition of what is considered high quality software can vary from person to person.
  - Therefore we cannot build a tool that adhears to a set standard, as there isnt one.
  - Instead the tool should be able to accept a schema that defines patterns and rules that to tool will attempt to adhear to.

### Evaluation

Quotes to include:
- Software Engineering (SE) has very peculiar characteristics that strongly relate it to social sciences that encourage the implementation of empirical studies that are able to assess the effectiveness of techniques, methodologies and processes proposed in the area. (IEEE-6606742)
- **no tool succeeds in all respects** (IEEE-8681007)

### Introduction

Quotes to include:
- Nowadays, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is one of the most used programming paradigm [1]. (IEEE-6606742)

Statements:
- This project aims to provide a solution to the problem of creating high quality code and structured code.
- Research was made into the area of software quality and the different approaches that have been proposed to measure software quality.
- It was found that there is a lack of standardisation in the way software quality is measured and that there is a demand for high quality code.
- It was also found that while there are many proposed approaches to measuring software quality, not many of them have not been widely adopted.
- The proposed solution is to create a tool that can analyze source code and format it to a schema while making use of object oriented programming principles.
