% Prototype
% Describe your prototype. Prototypes may be functional or theoretical.
% Review of technology
% If you need to review technologies this is perhaps the place to do it. Perhaps you need a data base, in which case state what database engines have you considered, which have you decided to use and for what reason. Perhaps you need an app, in which case you could, for example, state which development frameworks are available, compare and contrast all, select 3 for detailed comparison, choose one and state why you have made this choice.
