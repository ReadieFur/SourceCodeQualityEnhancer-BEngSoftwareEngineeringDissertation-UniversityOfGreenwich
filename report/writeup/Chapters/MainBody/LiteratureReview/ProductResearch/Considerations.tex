% Legal, social, ethical, professional issues and considerations
% You may find it helpful to include a list of all applicable laws and perhaps other laws that you have considered and excluded, with reasons why they do not apply, if appropriate. It is generally not a good idea to decompose this section into sections labelled as ‘Legal’, ‘Social’, and so on as these aspects are intimately related.

Before undertaking the development of this project, a number of considerations must made to ensure that the project would be successful. A first consideration is the choice of programming language. It has been decided that the project would be developed in and for the C\# language as this is a widely used making this a valid candidate for this project. While it would be desirable to create a tool that supports multiple languages, this would have a significant impact on the complexity of the project and so it was decided that the project would be limited to C\# due to the time restraints of the project in addition to my knowledge of other languages not being as strong as that of C\#.
As previously discussed, software quality does not have a set-in-stone definition, so in order to measure the quality of the software that is produced a baseline of things will be measured, such as consistency of the code, maintainability through the use of up-to-date language features, the use of object oriented programming principles and design patterns, and the ease of readability of the code. These are all important factors that can be used to measure the quality of the software that is produced in this project.
% TODO: How are these actually measured?
