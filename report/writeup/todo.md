Literature review:
Work upon the proposal
Expand the problem domain
More detailed introduction
All work should be additive to the final result
Add more detail where possible to the methododology
Create a list/workflow of the system, what do I need to research, what can I already do, how should the system work
Methodology in the proposal was high level, now break it down to what it involcves, how to do it, software requirements, research, contextual dependdency and checks, etc
Design principles and patterns requires further research, gather examples for pre-existing points Ive made and how I would impliment that into a programatic solution
Reread the proposal, what more do I know now, what do I not know and how cna that be tackled.
It is ok to say xyz isnt possible because of abc, but it is important to say how you would overcome that and what you would do instead
Document the problems and thoughts/soultuons I have throughtout the project development
Main point - expand upon detail
Identify test cases
How will it work in reality
Discuss legal social ethical and professional issues
  > Possibly interview people for their opinions
  > Does the system peform as expected
  > How is integrity maintained, it dosent have to be perfect but show that ive considered certain thoughts. e.g. I cant have the tool make breaking changes
Project planning, how am I going to fit the project into the avaliable time and the features and requirements that are needed for my project, Identify all the tasks I need to do, graph it up with gantt charts (easy marks), make sure the gantt chart includes all aspects of the project, deliverables, research etc.

Contextual report:
ask myself what is the problem, is it possible to do xyz, what are the issues, what are the solutions, what are the alternatives, what are the advantages and disadvantages of each solution, what is the best solution and why, how will it be implimented, what are the risks, what are the ethical issues
i.e. is it possible to enhance the quality of source coode in these areas, what technologires can I use, limitations of languages and their features, what are the laternatives
these things above develop the entire project
break down the task into smaller chuinks, devide and cojnquer, so that it is easier to digest
what would be critical for success, what do I need to get it t owork, why are they importatnt. it helps supervisors to understand the challanges of the task and again why its importantt and what the overall risk is

prototype:
dosent have to work but can demonsrate the idea, paper design, inputs and outputs etc
how interactive is the tool, is it like a blackbox where "magic happens" or is it more like a feedback loop

almost everyting comes down to x is needed and the solution is either literature review research, code, design and implimentation or tests, and how can I show the tasks that I have done to achieve that and how they fit into my timeframe
the work does not need to be done in a specific order, but it is important to show that I have considered the order of the tasks and how they fit into the timeframe, it is reccomened that research is conducted alongside the development though
it is about features and requirements, not the amount of code I write. demonstaratng that I understand what I am doing and why I am doing it is more important than the amount of code I write and its functionality
make it very clear about the problem i want to solve and why it is important to solve it, captures both markers to keep them involved
brighter minds are those who show the steps along the entire way, not just the final result
dont loose the idea of keeping mistakes in the report, if something is too challangint or something didnt work, document it, showing the mistakes and my efforts around it shows how I have worked around a problem or that I even considered it rather than just showing results, it really shows my knowledge and effort, show your flaws as well as your successes
keep building upon what I already have done in terms of the report, it will save loads of time and effort, expand and modify
if possible impliment ideas from other courses to show other knowledge
if running out of word count, you can defer some things to an appendix to show it was considered but was too much for the body of the report
diagrams can help visualise the report and make it "friendlier" to read, images captures liots of words and can be especially useful when it is hard to describe things in words
