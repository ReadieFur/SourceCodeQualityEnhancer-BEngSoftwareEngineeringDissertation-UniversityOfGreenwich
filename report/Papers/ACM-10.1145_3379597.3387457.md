### Synopsis
this paper looks into what code smells are and demonstrate a machine learning model to rank the level code smells in source code.

### Useful Quotes
current approaches do not take the developerâ€™s perception of design issuesinto account.
Code smells have been often associated to a decrease of program comprehensibility [1], maintainability [38,59], testability [28]aswell as an increase of maintenance effort and costs [80].
