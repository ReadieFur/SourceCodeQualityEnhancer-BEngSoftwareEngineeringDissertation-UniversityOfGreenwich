This project seeks to provide a solution to the problem of creating high quality code and structured code. Research was made into the area of software quality and the different approaches that have been proposed to measure software quality using papers and resources found primarily on on IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library.
It had been found that there is a lack of standardization in the way software quality is measured and that there is a demand for high quality code. Additionally, while there were many proposed approaches to measuring software quality, not many of them have not been widely adopted.
This project aims to create a solution to these problems by making a tool that can analyze source code and format it to a user-defined schema while making use of object oriented programming principles.
