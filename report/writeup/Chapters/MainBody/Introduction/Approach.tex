\subsection{Project overview}
% Approach
% The approach should describe how the project will be carried out, and what methods will be used.
This paper will discuss the current state of source code quality and the importance of maintaining a high quality codebase. It discusses how there is a lack of uniformity in coding styles and how this can lead to a decrease in efficiency within development teams and thereby cause increased costs and time to develop a project.
The paper also shows an in-depth implementation of a program that can aid in increasing software quality and how it can be used to reformat source code to a user defined style with support for object oriented programming principles in combination with design patterns to create a well structured and higher quality codebase from a pre-existing codebase, or from scratch.
Throughout this paper the use of the spiral software development methodology is used as it suits the project area well.
