Project proposal
The project proposal should detail your proposed problem/topic of investigation and must include a sufficiently broad literature review to establish the feasibility of your project. The purpose of the proposal is to ensure you have a sufficiently scoped project that meets the requirements as agreed with your supervisor. It must provide sufficient rationale for the project, which may include an indication of why the project is of interest, a preliminary investigation into the concepts, theory, and current research available to underpin the project, and some indication of what methods might be adopted to implement and evaluate the project. You must demonstrate you are aware of the concepts/theories/frameworks/etc. underpinning the specific area you're working on. The proposal should also outline a clear project aim (what the project will produce) and a set of realistic objectives, including a brief exposition of how these objectives are to be met.

Contextual Report
The initial report should demonstrate the research conducted concerning your domain area and present a coherent argument that shows current thinking and practices. This essentially should form the first draft of your final report and you may use relevant sections from the final report template to write your initial report. Typically, you should have a complete literature review section that contains a critical conclusion showing how your research has informed your design and implementation decisions. The document should include an exposition about any designs and implementation you have achieved so far and a statement on your progress to date (you may refer back to your project plan for this). 

Final Report Structure
Your final report should include at a minimum the sections outlined in the Final Report Structure above.
