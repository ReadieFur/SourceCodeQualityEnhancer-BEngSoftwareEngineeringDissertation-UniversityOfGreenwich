% Review of the literature
% Review the literature that you have found, and discuss what you have found.
% This is not a review of technology; it should be a review of literature. Do not simply summarize each source in sequence.
% Your literature review should not be a compilation of facts and feelings but a coherent argument that leads into the description of the proposed study.
\subsubsection{Review}
This project will seek to present a solution to the problem of software quality by creating a tool that can analyze source code and reformat it such that it makes use of object oriented programming principles in combination with design patterns to create a well structured and higher quality codebase from a pre-existing codebase.
However, such a tool cannot be created without researching further into the following topics: Existing approaches; Defining software quality; Object oriented programming principles and design patterns. Further research will be conducted into these topics in the methodology section of the literature review.
