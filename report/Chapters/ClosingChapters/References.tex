% List of references
% References should be ordered alphabetically by the name of the author, or, if there is more than one, the name of the first author. The Harvard system is used (more information is available on the project website) and each reference should state the author’s name and initials, date (in parentheses), title, publisher, and place of issue (if known).
% Appropriate references should also be included if material has been used from lecture notes that have been written by members of staff, from previous students’ project reports, or from laboratory manuals. These should cite the programme and course title together with the date of the course instance and the full name of the lecturer concerned.
% References mentioned in the text of the report should be cited by the name of author and the date, inside parentheses.
% If you fail to properly cite sources of information you will lay yourself open to accusations of plagiarism.
