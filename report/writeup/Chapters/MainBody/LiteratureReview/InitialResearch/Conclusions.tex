\subsubsection{Conclusions}
The research, and that conducted by others, shows that there is no standardized way to measure software quality. \cite{10.1145/3428029.3428047, 10.1145/2674683.2674702} said that "current approaches do not take the developer's perception of design issues into account", therefore we cannot just create a tool that coheres to a standard. Instead the tool should be able to accept a schema that defines patterns and rules that the tool will attempt to adhere to.
This is discussed more in section \ref{sec:Considerations} where other research undertaken is referenced in this paper when applicable to the section being discussed.
