Use LLM AI as an option and say that this is unfeasible for me because I would need to spend a long time acquiring permission to train the model, on top of this is the training would take a long time for it to become good.

Pure algorithmic solution is what I will defend as the best solution.

Elaborate why I am picking this topic and why I am picking the certain language I am going to be writing the project in and targeting.

Report structure (not project proposal):
1. Literature review
2. Design scenarios
3. (Waterfall.png)

Follow my iterative process where I bulletpoint each point to build an idea of what to write and iterate over that to build a written report

The proposal just identifies the problem and some solutions but now how those solutions will be implemented
