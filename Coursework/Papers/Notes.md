Create a bad code example and a good one then compare that to what my program can do

My tool could prove useful as a learning aid for new developers to learn new coding styles and mannerisms. As well as being useful for experienced developers to ensure a format or for large teams converting an old code base to a new format.

The nieche that my tool targets is not to specifically solve any one of the problems that I have researched but to rather reduce the issues that can arise from them. For example, my tool will not solve the issue of spaghetti code but it will help to reduce the amount of spaghetti code that is written.
