This project proposal seeks to provide a solution to the problem of creating high quality code and structured code. Research was made into the area of software quality and the different approaches that have been proposed to measure software quality, and it had been found that there is a lack of standardization in the way software quality is measured and that there is a demand for high quality code. It was also found that while there are many proposed approaches to measuring software quality, not many of them have not been widely adopted. The proposed solution is to create a tool that can analyze source code and format it to a schema while making use of object oriented programming principles.
