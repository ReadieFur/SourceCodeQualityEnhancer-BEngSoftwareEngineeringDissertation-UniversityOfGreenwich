% Review of the literature
% Review the literature that you have found, and discuss what you have found.
% This is not a review of technology; it should be a review of literature. Do not simply summarize each source in sequence.
% Your literature review should not be a compilation of facts and feelings but a coherent argument that leads into the description of the proposed study.
