% Aims and objectives
% The aims and objectives should describe the purpose of the project, and what it is intended to achieve.
The goals of this project are to create a tool that can: interpret source code; reformat it to a user defined style; support object oriented programming principles; supply integration with existing popular IDEs; and provide a user interface for batch reformatting operations. By the end of this paper a series of existing solutions will have been evaluated, expressing their pros and cons, which will be used to formulate a set of requirements for a new tool that will hope to address these issues.
