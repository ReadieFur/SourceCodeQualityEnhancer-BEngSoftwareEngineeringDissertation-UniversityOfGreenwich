### Synopsis

The abstract points out that teachers are expected to have an understanding of code style and how to analyse it in order to give feedback to students.
However research indicates that teachers often struggle with this task.
The papers goal is to understand the challanges they face and to find ways and methods to help them increase their effectiveness at providing feedback on code style.

### Useful Quotes

Some possible reasons for reduced effectivenessare a teacher’s own lack of coding experience
Stegeman et al. define code quality in terms of what can be deter-mined by “just looking at the source code, i.e. without ... checkingagainst the specification” [23].
Code quality aspects are categorised into tenquality criteria, relating todocumentation(naming, headers, com-ments),presentation( layout, formatting),algorithmic(flow, idiom,expressions) andstructure(decomposition, modularisation) [23].
For students and developers, terms relating to readability were prevalent whereas educators favoured terms relating to structure.
Code style refers to elements of the code that affect a developer’sability to understand a program, given the program works correctly.
poor naming choices ... arangeof ‘bad’ style choices.
ForRationale, most teachers mentioned the need for studentsto ensure their code can be read by others, either for facilitatingteamwork (First of all, that it’s easy to read.) or to support futuremaintenance (someone else might come along and have to fix yourprogram or change your program). This finding is consistent withthose reported by Börstler et al. [5].
