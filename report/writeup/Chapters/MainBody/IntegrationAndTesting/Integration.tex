\subsection{Integration}

The product that was developed was split into various modules. Each module was designed to be independent from one another. This has multiple advantages, such as making the code easier to maintain and allowing for easier debugging and modification. This was achieved through the use of various design patterns from the object oriented programming paradigm.

This section discusses the integration of the various modules that were developed, the ways that the user interacts with the system, and the ways that the system provides responses.
